# NihonSchool CRM
## Project Objective

The NihonSchool CRM project is a proof-of-concept Salesforce application designed to manage the operations of a Japanese language school.

The main goal is to demonstrate the ability to build a Salesforce application from scratch, combining:

- Declarative development (Lightning Apps, Flows, Reports, Dashboards)
- Custom objects and data model design
- Automation and business logic
- User interface and experience for school staff

This project will serve as a portfolio piece for demonstrating skills in Salesforce development for a junior developer position.

## Planned Features (MVP)

- Student Management
Track student information, JLPT level, enrollment status, and progress.

- Course Management
Manage courses, schedules, and teacher assignments.

- Enrollment Tracking
Link students to courses and monitor attendance or completion.

- Automation
Use Flows or Apex triggers to automate updates and notifications.

- Reporting & Dashboards
Provide insights such as number of students per JLPT level, course enrollment statistics, etc.

- Permissions & Profiles
Ensure appropriate access for teachers and administrators.

## Technology Stack

- Salesforce Lightning Experience
- SFDX CLI / Salesforce DX for source-driven development
- Git for version control
- Developer Sandbox as the working org environment

## Next Steps

1. Set up the Lightning App NihonSchool in Salesforce.
2. Create custom objects: Student, Course, Enrollment.
3. Implement basic tabs and navigation for the app.
4. Plan simple automation and reporting.
